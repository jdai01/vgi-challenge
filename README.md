# VGI Challenge: Real-Time Bus Visualization on a Map

## Objectives
The objective of this challenge is to create an interactive map that visualizes real-time bus locations using the SIRI-VM interface. 
The interface is designed to allow the upload of XML files by transport providers, such as Verkehrsverbund Gro√üraum Ingolstadt (VGI), to display geodata of buses in real time. 

The map will feature dynamic "pop-ups" that show essential information, including upcoming bus stops, real-time occupancy, and other relevant details for each stop. 
This setup aims to provide a live view of bus movements and passenger load, enhancing the public transit experience for users.

## Requirement
1. Upload an XML file from the SIRI-VM interface to display bus geodata.

## Set up
```bash
cd vgi_site
python manage.py runserver
```

## Further Information
The SIRI-VM interface is a standard for transmitting real-time vehicle monitoring data. 
The XML file will contain geolocation and other relevant data about bus movements.
